        # For safety, if you confirmed the cog adds them, these could be removed.

        # within its own on_ready. If that's the case, these lines below are
        # likely redundant and can be removed to avoid duplicate registrations.
        # For now, I'll keep them as they don't cause harm if views are unique.
        # But consider removing if the cog truly handles their full persistent setup.
        # This setup_hook handles views that are *not* tied to a specific cog's lifecycle.

        # If HelpView and CloseTicketView are meant to be tied to the TicketSystem cog,
        # they should ideally be added as persistent views within the TicketSystem cog's
        # own `on_ready` or `setup_hook` method.
        # Based on your `ticket.py` this is already happening:

        # and can be removed to rely solely on the cog's setup for its views.

        # For simplicity and to avoid confusion, I'm going to assume HelpView and CloseTicketView
        # are indeed handled by the `TicketSystem` cog and remove these lines from `bot.py`'s `setup_hook`.

# Based on your ticket.py, these classes are imported and passed to the cog,
# and the cog handles `bot.add_view`. So, these global definitions are likely not needed
# unless you intend to add them directly from bot.py's setup_hook as well (which would be redundant).
# For now, I'll keep them as placeholders, but be aware they might be removable if fully cog-managed.

# If HelpView and CloseTicketView are *only* defined in a separate file like views/ticket_views.py
# and are handled by the TicketSystem cog's on_ready, then their class definitions
# do *not* need to be here. I'm removing the placeholder `pass` definitions.
# Ensure they are properly imported in relevant files if they're not global.
